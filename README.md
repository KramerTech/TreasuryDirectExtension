# TreasuryDirect Password Enabler

The on-screen keyboard annoyed me the two times a year I'd log in to check my I-bonds. So I spent twenty minutes making this extension that automatically removes the "read-only" flag from the password field on TreasuryDirect.com, allowing you to type your password or use a password manager instead of clicking it.

If I use it for the next 30 years, it'll have just about saved me the time it took to make.

Log in at [TreasuryDirect](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/RS/UN-Display.do) to see it in action.
